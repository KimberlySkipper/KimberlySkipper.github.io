title: Professional Imposter

[**Imposter syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome****) - (also known as **impostor phenomenon** or **fraud syndrome**) is a concept describing high-achieving individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud”.

Well I guess I have it.  I have never been in an immersion program and I am hitting it head on.  I am doing my best and I am learning but I feel like I am not where I need to be.  Objective-C is confusing me a bit and just when I think I understand, I suddenly get more confused.  It is like I take one step forward and ten steps back.  I am in a constant state of stress and wonder if I am ever going to learn to code.  Right now even typing this out I am getting a tightness in my neck, (specifically on the right side and I can feel the head ache coming on. lol  I am treating myself to weekly chair massages at Canvs.  The massage is every Thursday between 1-4pm.  I missed it once and I will not miss it again. :)  

I feel like I am supposed to be studying every second of every day.  I have guilt when I am not spending every waking hour at the computer reviewing code.  However I know that I need breaks.  Finding the balance between learning and life is curious.  I am sure I will start to get a handle on it as the cohort comes to an end.  On a good note we start swift today!!  It is supposed to make more sense and help things come together.  I still have to finish the Jackpot App in objective-C. Only to turn around an complete it in Swift.

I just have to remember that I started this program for me.  I wanted the mental stimulation and the challenge of learning something outside of my “box”.  When I gradulated from UF, a man gave a speech that year.  It became very popular.  It is called **Wear Sunscreen**. (See the entire speech below, from an article written in the Chicago tribune.) One line in the speech really hit home for me: ***"Do one thing every day that scares you.”***  I am a play-it-safe kind of a girl and to do things out of my proverbial box is how I grow.  I am not sure at this point how good of a programmer I will be but I can say that this is a life changing experience.  I am growing and so is my family.  I have to keep sight of the fact that no matter where I may land this course is beneficial to my family.

I wish I was able to learn everything from that famous speech. I am a worrier and I worry to about things that I can’t predict. ***"Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blind side you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday.”***
 
This is what I need to remember.  If I could stop worrying, life would go much more smoothly.  So for now this will be my mantra.  The only truth that I know is that I will figure it out when I figure it out.  An “aha” moment is coming. I am as excited as a kid in a candy store for it to get here.  When it does I will welcome it with open arms  :)  For now I will try to enjoy the excitement of treading water :)  


> In August 1997, e-mail enthusiasts burned up cyberspace sending each other the text of a commencement address said to have been delivered by Kurt Vonnegut, author of "Slaughterhouse Five" and other works. It was surely the most popular speech Kurt Vonnegut never wrote or delivered. As it happens, the sunscreen speech was actually a column written by [Chicago Tribune](http://www.planetgary.com/sunscreen.htm) columnist Mary Schmich. Here is "the speech".

> **Wear Sunscreen**

> By Mary Schmich of the Chicago Tribune
> 
> Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '98: Wear sunscreen. 
> 
> If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now. 
> 
> Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine. 
> 
> Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blind side you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday. 
> 
> Do one thing every day that scares you. 
> 
> Sing. 
> 
> Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours. 
> 
> Floss. 
> 
> Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself. 
> 
> Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. 
> 
> Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements. 
> 
> Stretch. 
> 
> Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't. 
> 
> Get plenty of calcium. 
> 
> Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone. 
> 
> Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's. 
> 
> Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. 
> 
> Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. 
> 
> Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. 
> 
> Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly. 
> 
> Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. 
> 
> Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. 
> 
> Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young. 
> 
> Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. 
> 
> Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. 
> 
> Travel. 
> 
> Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble, and children respected their elders. 
> 
> Respect your elders. 
> 
> Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out. 
> 
> Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85. 
> 
> Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth. 
> 
> But trust me on the sunscreen.
