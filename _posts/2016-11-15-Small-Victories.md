###Week 2 Blog

I finished week one but I would not say that I was unscathed.  Never having been through a "boot camp"  much less a coding boot camp, I was not able to prepare for the mental stress that I would endure.  It is hard not to question whether or not you are "cut out" for this program.  After having an emotional check on day 4, I have learned to just roll with it.  My new modo is "small victories".  I have learned to accept failure as the norm and not focus on it.  Now I reveal in my small successes.  As long as I continue to learn something every day I will continue to perserver.  Throughout my life I have become very independent when it comes to learning.  It is hard to accept that I have to be   depend on others to be successful in this class. Through collaberation I will get through this.
