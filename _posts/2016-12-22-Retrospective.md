I have come to realize that development takes time!......Lots of time.  Taking the time in the begining to do the design and data modeling is very important.  I thought that I had planned out my design well, however I did not, there were still changes that had to be made and ultimately I did not complete everything I set out to do.  The goal was to have a completed app, so with twenty for hours left,  I decided that I would stop working on the things that I had not completed, delete all of the irrelavant code, clean up and tweak what was working, so that I would have an application to present in it's entirity.  This experience was motivational in that I am most proud of "Simply Weather", because I did this!!  It is mine and I am looking forward to improving it and completing my original idea.  This project was the turning point for me. I am looking forward to designing and developing my own apps at my own pace. 

The Forecaster excercise prepared me for my final project by helping me to realize that preplanning is key.  I need to take the time to conceptualize my ideas and get them on paper and the white board before sitting down to code.  It also taught me that no matter how much I plan things, they will change.  I have learned about scope.  My ideas when I start out my not be able to be completed in the 3 weeks that are provided, so I need to be open to changing paths and move on in a new direction or removing items that will not allow me to have a finished project.   

The more I learn, the more excited and terrified I become to build my own apps.  I put a lot of pressure on myself to do my best and be the best.  I know that this is **impossible**....*to be the best*, but I can be the best that I can be.  Learning Swift and understanding the apple documentation and API are all "tall orders".  This is a long journey and I am here to enjoy the ride.  The excitement comes with knowing that I will one day build something amazing, and through the App Store I can share it with the world.  And that, my friends, is AWESOME!
